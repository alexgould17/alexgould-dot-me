# README

This is my fight song? No j/k but it is my take back my life song. Notepad & to-do-list for now.

## To Do

- Add actual page content to the following pages:
  - About
  - Index
  - Thanks
  - Blog Index
  - Projects index
- Add login system that hides admin stuff (create, update, delete for blogposts & projects) & remove all links, including to the login page. Login should only be accessible via directly typing the link into the url bar. Admin-accessible pages should have links between themselves & outward, but not inward.
- Add the following projects:
  - blocipedia
  - bloc-chat
  - bloccit
  - blocitoff
  - bloc-jams (add to Heroku)
  - kele (no host, just github)
  - westcoastwool?
- Add at least 1 blog post, like 800 words or more.
